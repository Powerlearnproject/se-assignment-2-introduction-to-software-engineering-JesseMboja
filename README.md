Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Is the application of a systematic approach using various methodologies and tools to develop and maintain a high quality software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software engineering involves an entire software development life cycle to develop and maintain software while in traditional programming, narrowly focuses on the direct act of writing code and debugging to solve specific problems or create particular functionalities.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
1.Planning- The project needs are identified, analyzed, prioritized, and arranged to determine the roadmap for development.
2.Analysis- Involves analysis of project’s requirements to understand the problem that needs to be solved. 
3.Design- Involves architectural planning to convert the recommended solution into a blueprint that meets the requirements gathered.
4.Implementation- The project is actually executed by coding and testing to create a working software system.
5.Maintenance- Maintenance involves update and modification of the software ensuring that it continues to meet the evolving user needs and adapts to changes in the environment.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
COMPARISON AND CONTRAST
1. Agile involves iterative and collaborative approach to software development while waterfall involves sequential approach to software development.
2. Agile emphasizes on flexibility and customer satisfaction to adapt to changes while waterfall focuses more on detailed planning and documentation therefore difficult to incorporate changes.
3. Agile continuously delivers a working software to the customer while in waterfall the project’s scope and requirements once at the beginning.
SCENARIOS OF PREFERENCE
1.Agile is preferred in projects with changing scope due to changing user needs, requirements and environment while Waterfall is preferred in projects whose scope is unlikely to change ensuring the project stays on track due to its reliability.
2.Agile is preferred in projects with high customer involvement and collaboration while waterfall is preferred in projects with limited customer involvement in the development process.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
DEFINITION
Requirements engineering involves identifying, gathering and documenting the requirements that are to be met by the software system being developed.
PROCESS
The requirements engineering process is done in 2 phases:
Requirements determination- Developers work with users to determine what the users want from the proposed software system.
Requirements analysis- In this phase, developers study the gathered requirements and structure them  according to their interrelationships and eliminate any redundancies. 
IMPORTANCE
By clearly defining the requirements, developers can design and implement a software system that meets the needs of its users, resulting in a higher-quality product that is more likely to be successful in the market due to its usefulness to the user or client.
 
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularity in software design refers to the breaking down a software system into smaller, independent, and manageable components or modules.
HOW IT IMPROVES MAINTAINABILITY AND SCALABILITY
1. Easier updates: Changes and updates to one module do not affect the rest of the system, making it easier to maintain and update the software.
2. Improved Understanding: Smaller, independent modules are manageable making it easier to understand for developers.
3. Reusability: Modularity allows for code reuse as modules can be reused in other parts of the same or different software systems.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
LEVELS OF SOFTWARE TESTING
1. Unit testing: Involves testing individual units of a code such as a function.
2. integration testing: After the individual units of code are tested, they are integrated into the larger system and the resulting integrated product is tested to ensure that the integrated units work together as expected.
3. System testing: Tests the whole software system to ensure that it meets the system requirements and well perfoms as expected.
4. Acceptance testing: Final stage of testing where the software is tested to verify that it actually meets the user's needs.
IMPORTANCE OF TESTING
1. Early Bug Detection: Early error correction is a lot easier and cheaper than when already released.
2. Ensures software Quality: Testing helps to ensure that the software works as intended with no errors and user satisfied with the software operation.
3. Confirms Security: Penetration testing is done to identify potential security loopholes that could be exploited and therefore the security levels are upgraded.
4. Facilitates regulatory Compliance: Done to ensure the software complies with the relevant standards, regulations and compliances.
5. Meeting Requirements: Testing verifies that the software meets the defined user requirements and specifications for it to be of relevance in the market. 

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
DEFINITION
Version control system are tools that keep track of changes made to a codebase allowing for multiple developers work and collaborate on the same project effectively.
IMPORTANCES
1. Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to collaborate on the same codebase by merging individual contributions into the developed software.
2. Change recording: All changes made are tracked clearly showing the development history with all the subsequent changes made while developing the software.
3. Backup and restore: VCS provides a backup of the codebase, ensuring that previous versions can be recovered incase files are lost.
4. Branching and merging: Enables a developer to create an isolated branch with purposes of working on new features without affecting the main codebase. Merging facilitates integration of features the back into the main codebase.
EXAMPLES
1. Git- Is a distributed version control system allowing multiple users to collaborate on the same project
2. Subversion- Is a centralized version control system allowing teams to look at previous file versions and track their changes over time.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
A software project manager is responsible for planning and overseeing the entire process of the software development from start to completion.
RESPONSIBILITIES
1. Project Planning: Define project scope involving determining and documenting a list of specific project goals, deliverables, tasks, costs and deadlines.
2. Team Management: Assembles and manage the project development team based on project requirements.
3. Supervises and monitors project development: Monitors the development progress, track performance, and ensures adherence to plans.
4. Communication: Communicates with the project development team and with the stakeholders updating the stakeholders regularly of the ongoing progress.
5. Quality Assurance: Oversees the development process to validate the software meets user requirements and tested to perfom effectively.
6. Project delivery: Delivers the completed project to the client or user.
CHALLENGES
1. Constant scope change: Requirements and business environments often change during the project lifecycle requiring continuous re-planning causing development delays.
2. Miscommunication: Misunderstanding, miscommunications, and misinterpretations can cause strife between team members, lead to poor outcomes, and delay project completion.
3. Resource Management Challenges: Challenges in allocating and managing resources such as allocating the right and skilled personnel into the right department.
4. Poor Planning and Unrealistic Deadlines: May lead to rushed development to meet the set deadline and increases likelihood of errors.
5. Complexity: Software projects often involve complex processes, numerous dependencies, and interrelated components, making it difficult to predict and manage risks.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
